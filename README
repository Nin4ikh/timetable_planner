#Timetable Planner

## objective
create a course-timeslot-assignation (matrix) based on the defined priorities:
    - number of maximum courses per day
    - grouping of courses (e.g. two courses of the same subject on one day must be put after each other)
and an objective function that maximizes an artificial value (reward) and ensures the non-violation of constraints:
    - a teacher is capable of teaching a subject in a specific grade
    - a teacher cannot be at two places at once
    - a school-class cannot be at two places at once
    - a student cannot be at two places at once (for the 12/13 grade)
with the soft constraint:
    - earlier slots are preferred over later
